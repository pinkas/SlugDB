# SlugDB


The SlugDB is a database solution for Unity (**you'll need [Odin](https://odininspector.com/) to use it**, Odin is obviously not included in the repository and you'll get compiler errors when cloning/downloading until you import it to your project)

SlugDB's goal is to combine Unity's powerfull editor scripting with a traditional database approach (think MySQL). Most of the heavy lifting in terms of editor scripting will be left to Odin and will allow us to edit json text files in the Unity.

### Why not 'just' use Scriptable objects or MySQL?

### How to use

### A few gifs

### still a work in progress

### Notes:

#### - Memory consumption
#### - Experimental branch
